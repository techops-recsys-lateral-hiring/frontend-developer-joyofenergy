# Introducing JOI Energy

JOI Energy is a new start-up in the energy industry. They provide their customers with smart meters that record their
energy usage, enabling them to save both money and the environment. The smart meters also record the energy that
a customer feeds back into the power grid via solar panels installed on their property.

You have been placed into the development team, whose current goal is to build a dashboard which will display the information gathered from the smart meters.

Unfortunately, two members of the team are on annual leave, and another one has called in sick! You are left with
another ThoughtWorker to progress with the current user stories. This is your chance to make an impact on the business, improve the code base and deliver value.
